```

**2. Natural Language:**
```
"Can you help me create a proper commit message for adding user authentication?"
```

**3. Direct Reference:**
```
"Use the conventional commit agent to review my recent commits"
```

## Available Agents

### 🟢 Conventional Commit Validator
**Purpose:** Validate, format, and create commit messages following Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Validates existing commit messages against the specification
- ✨ Generates properly formatted commit messages from descriptions
- 📚 Educates teams on conventional commit standards
- 🔧 Suggests improvements for better commit quality

### 🔵 Linter Orchestrator Agent
**Purpose:** Multi-language code quality analysis with parallel issue resolution

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 Analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, and general files
- ⚡ Spawns parallel agents for each detected issue
- 🔒 Linux-style file locking prevents conflicts
- 🧹 Automatic stale lock cleanup and error handling
- 📊 Comprehensive reporting with fix summaries

### 🟡 Issue Resolver Agent
**Purpose:** Specialized fixing of individual linting issues with file coordination

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 Focused single-issue resolution
- 🔐 Task ID-based file locking coordination  
- 🛠️ Language-specific fix implementations
- 🔄 Graceful conflict handling and retry logic
- ✨ Safe, non-breaking automated corrections

**Example Usage:**
```
"I've added a new user authentication system and fixed a bug in the login form. 
Can you help me create proper commit messages?"
```

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll help you create conventional commit messages for these changes:

1. For the authentication system:
feat(auth): add user authentication system

2. For the login bug fix:
fix(login): resolve form validation issue

These follow the conventional commits specification with proper types and clear descriptions.
```

### 🔄 Parallel Linter System
**Usage:** The linter agents work together for comprehensive code quality management

**Example Usage:**
```
"Can you lint my entire project and fix all the issues you can?"
```

**System Response:**
```

## How Agents Work

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define:

```yaml
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Detailed description with usage examples
tools: Available tool list
model: Preferred Claude model
color: UI color indicator
---
```

The markdown body contains specialized instructions that give Claude focused expertise in specific domains.

## Development
